# Flower-Image-Classification-with-InceptionV3

### Introduction
This repository contains a deep learning project for flower image classification using the InceptionV3 CNN architecture. The project leverages transfer learning on the InceptionV3 pre-trained model, fine-tuning it on a specific dataset of flower images.

----------------------

Dataset Used: 
##### Flower Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/flower-classification/data)
- This dataset contains images of 14 distinct flower types: carnation, iris, bluebells, golden English, roses, fallen nephews, tulips, marigolds, dandelions, chrysanthemums, black-eyed daisies, water lilies, sunflowers, and daisies. It includes 13,618 training images and 98 validation images, with a total size of 202MB.

----------------------

Architecture Used: 
##### InceptionV3
- a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture developed by Google as part of the GoogLeNet project, it represents the third edition of Google's Inception Convolutional Neural Network introduced during the ImageNet Recognition Challenge. It has 48 layers & has been pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, containing millions of labeled images spanning thousands of classes. Additionally, it is well-known for its application in computer vision projects.
